                <p>I'm a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.liveperson.com/">LivePerson Inc</a>, specialized in natural language processing. I worked at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> in an Alexa team as a Software Engineer, building machine learning platforms. Luckily all the teams I stayed are friendly and highly efficient, and I have learned a lot from my teammates and leaders. Through my experience I have become fond of both data science and software engineering.
